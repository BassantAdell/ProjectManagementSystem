# ProjectManagementSystem
The PMS project uses CQRS for efficient command-query separation, custom APIs, and handles exceptions with custom responses. It allows adding projects, tasks, and assigning tasks to users within a project. Users can group tasks, update their status, and monitor progress through an integrated dashboard.
